- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @harperbaer
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a student at Stanford University studying mathematics and earth systems, but I'm very interested in the power of CS, plus I have fun coding,
- so I'm dipping my toe in the CS world by creating this account!
- ğŸŒ± I know Python and C++, and I've taken intro classes on object-oriented programming and abstraction.
- ğŸ“« You can reach me at hsbaer@stanford.edu
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
